*Here are some of the highlights:*

## Treesitter

Many treesitter performance improvements have been merged and released in 0.11.

### Async parsing

<https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/31631>

### Non-blocking injection query

<https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/32000>

## gx fixed

[`gx`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/various.html#gx) in neovim opens a filepath or URL under the cursor.

Previously, if you try to `gx` an URL on markdown files, you should find out that it doesn't work if your cursor is on the link text.

```
[...](https://...)
  ^
```

> Doesn't work ðŸ« 

With this fixed, you can now `gx` on anywhere in the link text!

### Bonus tips

Check this plugin out for enhanced `gx` functionality, including:

- hover over a plugin name to open the plugin github page in the browser
- the word/selection is automatically searched on the web, if there is no url found under the cursor

### Double diagnostic text

Disable `nvim-lspconfig` virtual text

``` lua
return {
  "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",
  opts = {
    diagnostics = {
      virtual_text = false,
    },
  },
}
```

### Toggle diagnostic virtual lines and virtual text

``` lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>tdd', function()
    vim.diagnostic.config {
        virtual_lines = not vim.diagnostic.config().virtual_lines,
        virtual_text = not vim.diagnostic.config().virtual_text,
     }
end, { desc = 'Toggle diagnostic virtual lines and virtual text' })
```

## Default keymaps

Mappings inspired by Tim Pope's vim-unimpaired:

- `[q`, `]q`, `[Q`, `]Q`, `[CTRL-Q`, `]CTRL-Q` navigate through the quickfix list
- `[l`, `]l`, `[L`, `]L`, `[CTRL-L`, `]CTRL-L` navigate through the location-list
- `[t`, `]t`, `[T`, `]T`, `[CTRL-T`, `]CTRL-T` navigate through the tag-matchlist
- `[a`, `]a`, `[A`, `]A` navigate through the argument-list
- `[b`, `]b`, `[B`, `]B` navigate through the buffer-list
- `[<Space>`, `]<Space>` add an empty line above and below the cursor
- `[[` and `]]` in Normal mode jump between shell prompts for shells which emit OSC 133 sequences ("shell integration" or "semantic prompts").
